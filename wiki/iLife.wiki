== instructions on building from the iLife branch ==

= Introduction =

The developers have been using/developing on the iLife branch for over half a year now.
We think it's about time to push things towards stable.
We invite the daredevils amongst [http://dotmac.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/plotgraph.png you] to try installing from the iLife branch - and give us feedback.


= Install =

Install is globally the same as from trunk.
The first thing you'll notice when migrating is that your current setup will be broken; this is because we moved to a user db backend - which needs to be in sync with the .htdigest database.
The easiest way out (now) is re-creating your users with idiskAdmin (you won't lose any files (we hope) on idisk).

idiskAdmin features a new button 'Generate HTDigest Files' which you'll want to hit after changing/adding users. It syncs the user db with the .htdigest file.
Restarting Apache reflects your user changes.

Besides the perl modules needed for trunk we need a few more (available from CPAN):
 * LWP::UserAgent
 * JSON
 * POSIX
 * Imager
Before installing Imager, *you'll need to make sure to have jpeg headers installed*. On common linux distibutions these are packaged as libjpeg-devel. On Mac OS Leopard google is your friend.

(the list might not be complete - please let us know when you find missing modules)


We've opened a [http://code.google.com/p/dotmac/issues/detail?id=88 new issue] where we hope to gather your experiences/issues. Please help us out making this page complete.


= Notes =

iPhoto and iWeb publishing have only been tested with iLife '08 with latest updates. We won't support earlier versions/revisions.
