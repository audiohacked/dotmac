New PERL dependencies:

HTML::Embperl


There are some permissions that need to be setup:


chown -R <apache user> <dotmac root>/cache
chown -R <apache user> <dotmac root>/certs/csrs
chown -R <apache user> <dotmac root>/certs/pkcs12
chown -R <apache user> <dotmac root>/certs/dotmacCA
chown -R <apache user> <dotmac root>/certs/dmSharedServices

Clear out the .svn direcories from idisk.
In <dotmac root>/idisk
type: find <dotmac root>/idisk -name '.svn' -type d
	If this prints out what you expect
	type: find <dotmac root>/idisk -name '.svn' -type d -exec rm -r {} \;


Added new really poorly coded cachingproxy. No one should actually use it in production. I'm not yet sanitizing the input


We should really have a script for users to run that goes and downloads the gallery.html and gallery.js, and then does a search and replace for the local site name

Also it looks like iWeb obeys the site names in publishConfiguration08.plist, but iPhoto doesn't. Its not a huge deal, but it when publishing is completed, it shows 
your local URL in the dialog box. Also you could do away with publish.mac.com (but just for iWeb)

There are a number of new sites that are being seen... really all the me.com versions of the oldies. They should all be added to the clients hosts file 
idisk.me.com
certmgmt.me.com
certinfo.me.com
gallery.me.com
publish.me.com
web.me.com
etc...

/idiskAdmin is now only on the SSL address, and is availble from any of the names (not just configuration.apple.com). Only the modify existing users page is completed
