# Robsworking branch merged to trunk, and robsworking and ilife branches deprecated #
For any users currently using trunk, you will receive a large update the next time you sync. We suggest that you back up your current install before trying the "new" trunk.
If you are currently using the robsworking branch, you will need to switch to trunk to get any future updates.

# Snow Leopard Support #
There is preliminary support for Snow Leopard in the iLife branch. If you are using Snow Leopard please give it a try. If you have any issues with it, please post them [here](http://code.google.com/p/dotmac/issues/detail?id=110)

# Project Name Change !!!! #
**At the request of Apple, we will be changing the name of our project. We have decided on  [dotMobile.us](http://www.dotmobile.us) Please bookmark that URL. We will be transitioning to a new project space and that URL will follow us where ever we go.**



# What if...? #
  * you don’t think a few lousy gig’s of disk space on .Mac is enough
  * you think .Mac is a bit slow
  * you’d like backup.app to work without paying an annual fee

## Well... build your own dotMac ##

The following features should be expected to work on both 10.4 and 10.5:

  * Data synchronization for any application that supports .Mac (iCal, Address Book, notes, etc...)
> _Note: Data synchronization between 10.4 and 10.5 isn't  (and probably won't be) implemented_
  * iDisk
  * iDisk sync
> _Note: If you are using multiple clients, please stick to either using idisk sync on all, or just straight idisk on all. This will be fixed in the second release_
  * Backup

Please give the code a try, and let us know if you run into any problems [here](http://code.google.com/p/dotmac/issues/list)

### Security issue found ###
Please go here for detais http://code.google.com/p/dotmac/issues/detail?id=44


### Tools that we use and recommend ###
There are two very important pieces of software that we use to help decode the protocols for use in dotMobile.us. Without them, we probably would have given up long ago.
They are:
**[DAV Explorer](http://www.davexplorer.org/) - Open Source Java Application**[Charles Web Proxy](http://www.charlesproxy.com/) - Shareware application that the author graciously donated to us for use with this project. Anyone that has to do any HTTP/HTTPS programming or debugging should pick up a copy of this.

## the iLife branch ##
### not for the fainted hearted ###
We're trying to push the iLife branch towards stable.
We're looking for people willing to install from the iLife branch;
basic features like in trunk will still work - others might update regularly over time.
iLife introduced a .db user backend which'll break your current setup;
We've set up a special issue page on iLife [here](http://code.google.com/p/dotmac/issues/detail?id=88)
We need people both documenting and reporting errors.
